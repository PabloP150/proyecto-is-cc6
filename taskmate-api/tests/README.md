# LLM Chat WebSocket Tests

This directory contains comprehensive unit tests for the LLM Chat WebSocket feature components.

## Test Coverage

### SessionManager Tests (`SessionManager.test.js`)
- **Coverage**: 96.87% statements, 100% branches, 100% functions
- **Tests**: 16 test cases covering:
  - Session creation and initialization
  - Session cleanup and resource management
  - Error handling for connection and cleanup failures
  - Session isolation between multiple users
  - Session retrieval by WebSocket and user ID
  - Active session counting

### UserSession Tests (`UserSession.test.js`)
- **Coverage**: 96.15% statements, 100% branches, 85.71% functions
- **Tests**: 25 test cases covering:
  - Session initialization and context setup
  - Message handling and processing
  - WebSocket communication
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Session cleanup and resource management
  - Session isolation and state management
  - Activity tracking

### LLMService Tests (`LLMService.test.js`)
- **Coverage**: 100% statements, 100% branches, 100% functions
- **Tests**: 22 test cases covering:
  - Service initialization with environment configuration
  - LLM API communication and response handling
  - Context-aware prompt building with user tasks and groups
  - Comprehensive error handling (timeouts, auth, rate limits, API errors)
  - Fallback response system when API is unavailable
  - Connection testing and validation
  - Request payload construction
  - System prompt generation with user context

## Key Features Tested

### Session Isolation
- Each user session maintains separate context and WebSocket connections
- Sessions are properly isolated from each other
- No data leakage between different user sessions

### Resource Management
- Proper cleanup of session resources on disconnect
- Memory management through context clearing
- WebSocket connection cleanup
- Graceful handling of cleanup errors

### Error Handling
- Robust error handling for initialization failures
- Graceful handling of WebSocket send errors
- Proper error recovery and user notification
- Cleanup error isolation (errors in one session don't affect others)
- LLM API error handling with appropriate fallback responses
- Network timeout and connection failure recovery
- Authentication and rate limiting error management

### Connection Management
- WebSocket state tracking (open, closed, connecting, closing)
- Automatic session cleanup on disconnect
- Support for multiple concurrent sessions
- Session retrieval by WebSocket reference or user ID
- LLM API connection testing and validation
- HTTP client configuration with proper timeouts and headers

### LLM Integration
- External LLM API communication (OpenAI, Anthropic compatible)
- Context-aware response generation using user tasks and groups
- Intelligent fallback responses when API is unavailable
- Configurable model parameters (temperature, max tokens, model selection)
- Request/response format handling and validation

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

- **Requirement 2.1**: LLM API communication for AI response generation
- **Requirement 2.2**: Context-aware AI responses using user task and group data
- **Requirement 2.3**: Session isolation per user with proper cleanup
- **Requirement 5.2**: Scalable session management for multiple concurrent users
- **Requirement 5.3**: Proper resource disposal and session cleanup

The LLM service integration provides intelligent AI assistance with robust error handling, fallback responses, and comprehensive test coverage, while the session management system ensures secure and scalable WebSocket communication.
