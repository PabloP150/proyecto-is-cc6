# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a real-time chat interface to the TaskMate application that allows users to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) via WebSocket connections. The chat will provide AI assistance for task management, planning, and general productivity support within the context of the user's existing tasks and groups.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a TaskMate user, I want to access a chat interface where I can communicate with an AI assistant, so that I can get help with task planning, organization, and productivity advice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user navigates to the chat page THEN the system SHALL display a clean chat interface with message history
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display the message immediately in the chat interface
3. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection if not already connected
4. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a TaskMate user, I want real-time communication with the AI assistant, so that I can have fluid conversations without page refreshes or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL transmit the message via WebSocket connection
2. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL receive and display the response in real-time
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL maintain session isolation per user
4. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
5. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the WebSocket connection and session resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a TaskMate user, I want the AI assistant to understand my context within the application, so that it can provide relevant assistance based on my tasks and groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a chat session THEN the system SHALL include user authentication context in the WebSocket connection
2. WHEN the AI processes a message THEN the system SHALL have access to the user's task and group data for context
3. WHEN a user asks about their tasks THEN the AI SHALL be able to reference their actual task data
4. IF a user mentions groups THEN the AI SHALL understand their group memberships and associated tasks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TaskMate user, I want the chat interface to be accessible from the main navigation, so that I can easily access AI assistance while working on other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL display a chat option in the main navigation
2. WHEN a user clicks the chat navigation item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the chat page
3. WHEN a user is on the chat page THEN the system SHALL highlight the chat navigation item as active
4. WHEN a user navigates away from chat THEN the system SHALL maintain the WebSocket connection in the background

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the WebSocket implementation to be secure and scalable, so that multiple users can chat simultaneously without security risks or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL validate user authentication
2. WHEN multiple users connect simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain separate isolated sessions
3. WHEN a user session ends THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of session resources
4. IF an unauthorized connection attempt occurs THEN the system SHALL reject the connection
5. WHEN the server restarts THEN existing WebSocket connections SHALL be handled gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a TaskMate user, I want a responsive and intuitive chat interface, so that I can easily read messages and type responses on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display messages in a scrollable conversation format
2. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
3. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL provide a text input with send button
4. WHEN a user presses Enter in the message input THEN the system SHALL send the message
5. WHEN the interface loads on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout
6. WHEN messages are long THEN the system SHALL wrap text appropriately and maintain readability
